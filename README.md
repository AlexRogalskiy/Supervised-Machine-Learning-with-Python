This is the code repository for [Supervised Machine Learning with Python](https://www2.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/supervised-machine-learning-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838825669), published by Packt.

**Develop rich Python coding practices while exploring supervised machine learning**

## What is this book about?
Supervised machine learning is used in a wide range of sectors (such as finance, online advertising, and analytics) because it allows you to train your system to make pricing predictions, campaign adjustments, customer recommendations, and much more while the system self-adjusts and makes decisions on its own. As a result, it's crucial to know how a machine "learns" under the hood.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Crack how a machine learns a concept and generalize its understanding to new data
* Uncover the fundamental differences between parametric and non-parametric models
* Implement and grok several well-known supervised learning algorithms from scratch
* Work with models in domains such as ecommerce and marketing
* Expand your expertise and use various algorithms such as regression, decision trees, and clustering
